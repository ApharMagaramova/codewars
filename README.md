[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/codewars-client.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/codewars-client/)

## what?

An unofficial client for the [Codewars](http://codewars.com) API. 

## why?

Because we like to solve programming challenges from our editor/environment, without
relying on the browser.

Because Codewars is the best resource I've found for improving my coding skills. Solving the problem yourself and then seeing other solutions for the exact same problem is a tremendous way to improve yourself. 

## usage?

Install it with

    npm install codewars-client

Now set it up with your API access token read from [https://www.codewars.com/users/edit](https://www.codewars.com/users/edit)

    codewars setup --token <token>

And you're golden, start training with

    codewars train
