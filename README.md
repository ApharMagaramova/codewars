[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shime/codewars.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/shime/codewars)

## what?

An unofficial client for the [Codewars](http://codewars.com) API. 

## why?

Because we like to solve programming challenges from our editor/environment, without
relying on the browser.

Because Codewars is the best resource I've found for improving my coding skills. Solving the problem yourself and then seeing other solutions for the exact same problem is a tremendous way to improve yourself. 

## usage?

Install it with

    npm install -g codewars

Now start using it with

    codewars setup

## license?

MIT
